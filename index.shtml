<h1>About DigiFAIL.com</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to DigiFAIL, the personal site of Tom Nardi,
better known on the Internet as MS3FGX. This site is a collection of things I
thought there was a chance people might find interesting. Be it Bash scripts,
guides, information on hardware I have, projects I am working on, or even the
projects that have miserably failed.
<p>
Which brings us to the name of the site itself. DigiFAIL stands for <i>Digital
Failure</i>, which I believe is a fairly good description for many (but,
thankfully, not all) of the things I work on. Not that the concept or execution
of these projects are necessarily flawed, but rather I have a tendency to take
on too many projects at once and by the time I get back to something, the idea
is often not quite as appealing as I once thought it was. It is this charming
character trait that lead me to create DigiFAIL and document the things I am
working on, in hopes that the information I have collected and work I have done
even on partially completed projects will serve somebody out there on the
Internet. It may be that something I got bored with is exactly the starting
point that another intrepid hacker has been looking for. That's the idea,
anyway...
<p>
If you have any thoughts, comments, or questions about this site or the
information and projects it contains, please don't hesitate to
<a href="/misc/contact.html" onClick="window.open('/misc/contact.html','Contact','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,width=500,height=640,left=50,top=50'); return false;">contact me</a>.
I always like to hear from people who have found my work online, and may have
even gotten some use out of it.
<h1>General Information</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This site was written 100% by hand in a combination
of <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">vim</a> and (when things got
really wild) <a href="http://www.geany.org/" target="_blank">Geany</a>. When I
decided to make this site I had absolutely no knowledge of HTML or CSS, and in
about 3 weeks I had created more or less the site you are viewing now. I mainly
did this by throwing a bunch of bits and pieces together and experimenting with
it until I broke something. As far as I know the site works properly on current
versions of Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. If you have problems,
and especially if you know how to fix them, please let me know.
