<h1>About</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;linux_ics started it's long life as "DS_AP", which
was a simple little script contained within the
<a href="/text/guides.shtml">DS Wireless Networking Guide</a> I wrote for
GameFAQs. "DS_AP", as the name suggests, setup a software access point for
use with the Nintendo DS, assuming your machine had a Master mode capable
WLAN device. It would also setup a DHCP server on the new interface so you
didn't have to manually configure the IP addresses, and even figured out the
routing and NAT settings in the kernel through iptables.
<p>
This worked fine for the DS Guide, as the DS had no other means of connecting
to the Internet than a WiFi AP. But when the Wii came out, it now offered two
different ways to get online (albeit, Ethernet is an option). When getting
ready to write the Wii Guide I realized that it would make much more sense to
write one script which could handle both WiFi and Ethernet connections. This
would mean it could work for any game console, and really, any other device
you could possibly think of. As I had seen many people on forums like
LinuxQuestions.org asking for help sharing an Internet connection out from
their Linux desktop, it seemed this software could help the community at large.
<p>
I then started a complete rewrite of the components of DS_AP and it's Wii
counterpart, and mixed in a lot of new functions and things I had learned since
writing the original script(s). I intended this to become an article for
<i>2600</i>, but somewhere towards the end I realized it wasn't a terribly good
article at all since the majority of the thing relied on the code itself
(around this time <i>2600</i> started pulling code out of the actual printed
issues anyway).
<p>
After this it basically languished in development hell for awhile, until I
created DigiFAIL and started putting my work up online. So now this script has
finally seen the light of day and might do some good out there. I feel
obligated to mention that I stopped working on this script after the
<i>2600</i> article fell through, and sort of forgot about it. As such, I am
not 100% sure that it works...or that it is even really complete. I read
through it a bit before putting it up online and did a few dry runs (without
WLAN hardware), and nothing seemed obviously broken. If you have problems with
it, please let me know via the Contact page.
<h1>Internal Functions</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;linux_ics is made up of many parts and does a number
of things from the time you run it to the time your interfaces are actually
setup. It's primary function is, naturally, to get NAT setup through iptables
between your primary and secondary interfaces. That much is easy, literally
only a line or two of code. The rest is a bit more involved...
<p>
If using WLAN, linux_ics configures your interface with iwconfig with the
basic settings like channel, rate, and SSID. It also sets the mode of the
device, where a little voodoo comes in. Not all devices are capable of the
so-called Master mode which let's them run as an access point. If your card can
do it, linux_ics will gladly set it up, but if not it will fall back on the
much more common Ad-Hoc mode. This will work fine for computers and such, but
more simplistic devices (like PDAs and game consoles) generally only know how
to get online through a proper AP, not Ad-Hoc.
<p>
With your interfaces configured it will then move on to starting the DHCP
server. When I wrote "DS_AP", you had to create your own configuration file for
the DHCP server, but with linux_ics I wanted things to be as streamlined as
possible. So I added in an option for linux_ics to create it's own
configuration file for the DHCP server based on automatically detected network
parameters. It should be able to adapt itself to whatever the network setup is
on your local machine, but of course I will remind you once again that this
software is still very much in the testing phase.
<p>
Finally, in an effort to make using linux_ics as easy as possible, I included
a self-test mode which does a number of tests to determine how likely it is
that you are going to have a problem. This includes scanning your system for
required programs (depending on the selected optional functions), testing the
capability of your WLAN hardware (if enabled), and verifying the names and
locations of configuration files. You can enable this by running linux_ics with
the "test" option.
<h1>How to use</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To run linux_ics, you first need to open up the
script and edit the top configuration portion to reflect your setup. The
defaults should be pretty sane in most cases, namely, DHCP enabled and using
two Ethernet devices. If you need to use WiFi or want to disable DHCP, then
just edit those configuration lines as explained in the comments for each one,
save the script, and run it.
<p>
Because of how many system functions linux_ics uses, it needs to be run as root
at all times. I know some people don't like this but you can read through the
source and see that nothing unusual is going on. Running linux_ics with no
options will list all of the available command switches, and running it with
"help" will give you a little more information. To start you should probably
run "test" to make sure your configuration is valid, and then use the "start",
"stop", and "restart" options to control the actual service. I wrote linux_ics
with the intent being that you could integrate it right into your boot scripts
so it starts and stops with the rest of your services.
<h1>Downloading</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get linux_ics on your system you can simply
copy and paste the code from the box on the bottom of this page and paste it
into a new file called linux_ics.sh, or else you can download the script
directly: <a href="ftp://ftp.digifail.com/downloads/software/scripts/linux_ics.sh">linux_ics.sh</a>

#-------------------------User Configuration Section---------------------------#

# DHCP Configuration:

# Disable/enable DHCP server (0 = Disable, 1 = Enable)
#    Enable this if you want to automatically configure the clients with
#    correct TCP/IP information. The default is 1, Enable.
USEDHCP=1

# DHCP configuration file
#    If you want DHCP support, you need this file. The default is "DHCP.conf",
#    located in /tmp. You can create this file by calling linux_ics with the
#    "dhcpconfig" command.
CONFFILE=/tmp/DHCP.conf

# Hardware Configuration:

# Source Interface
#    This is the interface connected to the main network or Internet. This can
#    be any interface on your machine. The default is your primary Ethernet
#    card, eth0.
SRC="eth0"

# Destination Interface
#    This is the device that will be used to share the connection to the
#    clients, normally an Ethernet card or a wireless device. The default is
#    your secondary Ethernet card, eth1.
DST="eth1"

# Destination Type (0 = Standard, 1 = WiFi)
#    This option determines if linux_ics attempts to configure the destination
#    interface as a wireless device. If you leave this disabled you can still
#    use a wireless destination interface, but you will need to configure it
#    outside of this script. The default is type 0, Standard.
DSTTYPE=0

# Source DHCP (0 = Disable, 1 = Enable)
#    Enable this if you want the source interface to be configured with DHCP
#    before the script runs. Usually you don't need to do this, so the default
#    is 0, Disable.
SRCUP=0

# DHCP hostname (only used if above is enabled)
#    If you want to configure your source interface with DHCP, this will be the
#    hostname it sends to the DHCP server. Useful if you want to see this
#    machine in your router's DHCP logs.
DHCPHOST="LINUX_ICS"

# Destination IP
#    This is the IP address given to the destination interface. The default
#    should work in most home networks.
IPADDR="192.168.2.1"

# WiFi Configuration:

# Wireless Mode
#    This determines which mode your card will try and run in. Can be either
#    "Master" or "Ad-Hoc". Since Ad-Hoc is much more likely to work, that is
#    the default.
WIFIMODE="Ad-Hoc"

# SSID
#    The name that your new wireless network will go by. If you don't see this
#    come up when you are searching for an AP, something is probably wrong.
SSID="LINUX_AP"

# Channel
#    6 should be a safe default, but if you get interference, you might want
#    to change it to something else.
CHANNEL=6

#------------------------No need to edit past this line------------------------#

# Values for tweaking:

# DHCP Timeout
#    How long to wait for DHCP lease on source interface.
DHCPTIME=20

# WiFi Rate
#    Data rate for wireless card.
RATE="Auto"
