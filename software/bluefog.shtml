<h1>About</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bluefog is an experimental tool designed to create large numbers
of phantom Bluetooth devices. The idea for Bluefog came while developing
<a href="/software/bluelog.shtml">Bluelog</a>, as I wished
there was a way I could test Bluelog without having to drag myself and my laptop to a public
area every time I wanted to scan for more than a handful of devices. Being able to generate
essentially infinite numbers of Bluetooth targets from one computer means easier and faster
development.
<p>
While Bluefog was originally conceived as a diagnostic tool, it also has its own defensive and
offensive uses. Being able to generate a flood of fake Bluetooth devices can confuse anyone
attempting to monitor or track physical Bluetooth hardware, as well as making legitimate Bluetooth
use considerably more difficult.
<h1>WARNING!</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bluefog is in a very early state of development, in fact, I wouldn't
normally release software at this stage. But since I think Bluefog is an interesting concept and
would like to get people's opinions on it, I'm throwing caution to the wind and letting it out
in the wild as is.
<p>
<B>BUT PLEASE BE CAREFUL...</b>
<p>
In its current state, Bluefog has almost no error handling and can easily misbehave; <i>especially</i>
if you're using Bluetooth hardware which I haven't had a chance to test with. Also, while the MAC
changing code is supposed to be temporary, I managed to permanently delete the MAC address of my
laptop's internal Bluetooth radio, so keep that in mind.
<h1>Basic Fogging</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To start fogging Bluetooth, you don't even need to pass
Bluefog any arguments, it will start up with the most reasonable options automatically:
<pre><code>bash:~# bluefog
Bluefog (v0.0.2) by MS3FGX
---------------------------
Bluetooth Interface: Auto
Device Name: Randomized
Available Names: 788
MAC Address: Randomized
Device Class: Randomized
Fogging started at [12/21/12 12:41:24] on 1 threads.
Hit Ctrl+C to end.
</code></pre>
<h1>Parallel Fogging</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the way Bluetooth scanners work, Bluefog needs
to take at least 20 seconds between switching its MAC address and device name.
This means that, with only one Bluetooth adapter, it will take awhile to generate
the fake devices.
<p>
To combat this, Bluefog supports multithreading to run parallel tasks on up to
4 physical Bluetooth adapters. If you have enough Bluetooth hardware, pass Bluefog
the "-t" option along with how many threads you want to run.
<h1>Coming Soon...</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The documentation for Bluefog is rather light right now,
but I'll be improving this steadily with time, as well as refining the code to
improve speed and capability. Be sure to check back regularly.
<p>
Any input at this early stage is very much appreciated.
