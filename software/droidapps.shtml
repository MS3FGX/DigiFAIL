<h1>There's an app for that.</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This page is going to be a little out of the
norm for DigiFAIL, as instead of doing original research or documenting my own
work, I am going to call out (in no particular order) a few Android
applications which I think are essential for the mobile hacker. Since this new
generation of Android devices is pretty much in uncharted territory in terms of
capability, I think I can get away with considering this "Research". I'll give a
little background information for all the applications, and if the application
is complicated enough perhaps even a bit of a tutorial. I plan on updating this
page regularly, so check back once and awhile to see what I've been playing with.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think it is safe to say that <i>WiFi Analyzer</i> is
one of the most well known tools for Android, and for good reason. It is an
absolutely incredible tool to have in the field when enumerating targets,
locating access points, or setting up new networks.
<p>
The primary goal of <i>WiFi Analyzer</i> is actually to locate the least
populated WiFi channel in your area so you can adjust your hardware
accordingly. But along the way it has gotten some really excellent features
such as the ability to chart signal strength of all detected APs over time. My
favorite feature is the ability to lock onto a single AP and have <i>WiFi
Analyzer</i> continually update you on it's signal strength via an analog dial
and audio cue. The faster the beeping and the higher the needle goes, the
closer you are to the target. It is an extremely intuitive and helpful
function to have when trying to locate a WiFi device. I should stress however
that <i>WiFi Analyzer</i> is <b>NOT</b> a WarDriving application, it doesn't
have any sort of location function and it doesn't even really log found APs.
If you are looking for an application that will let you generate WiFi heat maps
and the like, this is not it. But it does work excellent in conjunction with
such apps.
<p>
Despite being one of the most popular applications currently on the Android
Marketplace, <i>WiFi Analyzer</i> does not have a pay version nor a
donation-enhanced version. There are advertisements in the application, but even
those can be disabled from the menu. While the author, farproc, is obviously
not going to turn down a donation shot his way, he feels very strongly that the
software itself should remain free and has promised to always keep it that way.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I find <i>GPS Status</i> an exceptionally
interesting piece of software. As a very early GPS adopter (I had a Magellan
2000XL in 1998), it is amazing to me how far the technology has progressed in
so short a time. This single application gives me considerably more information
then my old stand-alone GPS ever did, and looks a whole lot better doing it.
<p>
When most people think of "GPS", they take it to mean the more modern
definition of the term: a device like a TomTom or a smartphone running
something like Google Navigation. In other words, something that has a full map
of the area with street names, points of interest, voice prompts, etc, etc. But
I still take it as a very literal term, a way to find your geographical
coordinates, elevation, speed, and heading. I use <i>GPS Status</i> on all
manners of adventures, especially when in the woods or on the water, places
where modern GPS devices and software (unless specialized for that environment)
are more or less useless.
<p>
In terms of specific features, my most used for this application would have to
be the ability to drop a marker and then switch to "Radar" mode, which gives
you an easy to interpret heading and range to those coordinates. I used this
function when doing the range tests on the
<a href="/hardware/hostxr.shtml">Host XR</a> range test, which allowed me to
measure the distance between the antenna and the target with a speed and
accuracy that would have been impractical otherwise.
<p>
The donation version of <i>GPS Status</i> costs ~$2.30 USD, and removes the
in-application ads and enables toggling the display of the top notification
bar. If you don't want to donate but are bothered by the advertisements,
EclipSim has a page on his site where you can get a code which disables the
advertisements without paying anything (though you will need to read through a
guilt-trip message).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>QuickSSHd</i> is the easiest way to get an SSH
daemon running on your Android device. Beyond being able to remotely log into
your device, it also gives you the ability to transfer files to and from the
system over SCP and SFTP. The interface is about as basic as could be, just
configure how you want to authenticate (password or key) and start.
<i>QuickSSHd</i> also includes a really nice widget that allows you to start
and stop the daemon right from your home screen, as well as show the current
IP SSH is listening on. Technically <i>QuickSSHd</i> will work over 3G and
WiFi, but in practice most carriers are blocking inbound ports, so 3G probably
won't work.
<p>
While <i>QuickSSHd</i> doesn't require root to function, it really shines when
running on a rooted device. As a normal user you will only be able to start the
daemon on ports above 1024, and you will only be able to access files on the
SD card. But when running as root, you will be able to start the daemon on the
standard port 22 and have full read/write access to the entire device
filesystem, which is very handy when modifying system files (especially if you
don't have the Android SDK installed). In addition, while not really a limitation
of <i>QuickSSHd</i> itself, on a stock firmware there isn't a whole lot you can
do with a remote shell. On the other hand, most custom ROMs include a full
BusyBox installation which gives you plenty of tools you can run from the shell.
<p>
I imagine the fact that there is no free or trial version of <i>QuickSSHd</i>
will put some people off. If for nothing else, it is nice to have a trial
version to verify the software works on your particular device and Android
environment. Still, for the people who want or need SSH and SCP functionality
on their Android devices, it is well worth the $1.50.

</b>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OK, I know what you are thinking. I realize that
<i>Tricorder</i> is intended as a toy, not a serious scientific tool. But
consider, presentation aside, that this application allows you to examine the
output of all of your device's sensors with impressive accuracy. A modern
smartphone like the <a href="/hardware/droid.shtml">Motorola Droid</a> has
multiple sensors which can detect everything from the angle and position of
the device to the local magnetic field. While these sensors were not
originally intended for anything more advanced then detecting when the device
is held up to your head rather than sitting in your pocket, with a little
imagination they can be used for slightly more interesting purposes.
<p>
For example, the "MAG" tab in <i>Tricorder</i> allows you to examine the
EMF field in the immediate area of the phone with micro-Tesla accuracy. In
the past I have successfully used this function to determine if an electrical
panel was receiving power or not. On one occasion, believe it or not, a friend
of mine had discovered what he believed to be a meteorite and I used
<i>Tricorder</i> to detect if the object had a higher magnetic field than other
rocks found in the surrounding area.
<p>
I have had similar success using the "ACO" mode which is a decently accurate
audio analyzer capable of showing both the waveform and frequency spectrum of
the sound detected by your devices's microphone. While accuracy and response
are dependent on the quality of the audio hardware (I.E. the Nexus One only has
an 8kHz hardware sample rate), it is serviceable on most devices.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>SystemPanel</i> is invaluable if you are going to
get into custom ROMs and Android hacking. It lets you see how your system's
resources are being distributed better than any other monitoring application in
the Marketplace. Function aside, it is probably one of the most visually
polished applications available on Android, a fine detail that sadly the vast
majority of Android applications seem to ignore.
<p>
<i>SystemPanel</i> is available in a Lite version which has pretty much all the
functionality that normal Android task managers have, which is to say that you
can view and kill tasks; plus the resource monitoring ability. While you don't
strictly need a task manager for Android, this would still be a better solution
then the rather rudimentary applications like <i>Advanced Task Killer</i> and
the like because you are still getting the resource monitoring functions that
none of the other task managers have.
<p>
For $2.99 you get the full version which adds in two extremely useful
functions. The first is the ability to monitor system resources over time.
You can let <i>SystemPanel</i> run in the background and record all of the
system information as the day goes on, and then review what applications were
taxing the system the most during the day. This helps greatly when trying to
track down that one piece of software which is killing your battery.
<p>
The second function is the ability to remove applications and back them up
to SD. Since <i>SystemPanel</i> doesn't (yet) support root you can't backup
protected applications or do the more advanced things like backup MMS/SMS, so
if you have root you should probably look at another backup utility. But on
non-rooted phones, it is one of the best ways to make backups of your
applications.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alright, I don't want to seem like I am pushing
NextApp's software, but these guys just happen to be one of the best developers
for Android right now so it turns out they have two noteworthy applications.
While <i>SystemPanel</i> is a great application and has all the polish you
expect for paid software, it is hard to imagine anything else coming close to
the functionality you get with <i>WebSharing</i>. Basically, this application
allows you to access all of the files on your device's SD card through a
web-based interface, completely eliminating the need to plug your phone into
the computer. At the same time, <i>WebSharing</i> avoids any proprietary
protocols or software, which means that any device with a modern web browser
is able to work as a client. Pretty much anything you could want to do with
the SD filesystem is available through the web interface: creating directories,
deleting files, batch upload and download, etc.
<p>
But while cable-less file transfers are great, the real beauty is in the paid
version of <i>WebSharing</i>, which is content aware and includes Flash-based
functions to display and playback all the media on your phone. This means that
not only can you upload and download things like videos and pictures from you
device, you can actually view them all right there in the browser. You can even
view things like signal strength, battery percentage, and storage capacity from
the web interface.
<p>
Honestly, it is really hard to describe just how awesome and seamless this whole
application is. An incredible amount of work went into this software, and
personally I would have to say this is the best overall Android application I
have used so far. Frankly, at $2.99 I think NextApp is really short-changing
themselves.
<h1>Titanium Backup</h1>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Titanium Backup</i> is arguably one of the best
reasons for rooting your phone; not only because it won't even start unless it
can get root permissions, but because it's simply the best backup solution on
Android. While there are other applications that can backup your applications
(some of them at least), and others that can backup system files like your
MMS/SMS storage, no backup tool brings it all together like
<i>Titanium Backup</i>.
<p>
On of <i>Titanium Backup's</i> biggest strengths is in it's ability to run batch
operations on all of the files on your device rather than having to go through
and select them manually. More than that though, it allows you to apply some
conditional arguments, such as only backing up things which have not been
backed up within the last few days, only backing up things which have not been
previously backed up, etc. Combined with <i>Titanium Backup's</i> scheduling
options, this allows you to create some very advanced backup routines. For
example, the default scheduled backups are setup to do backups of newly
installed applications twice a week, and a full device backup on the weekend.
<p>
Using <i>Titanium Backup's</i> batch mode makes switching between ROMs a breeze,
you just need to make sure your system is backed up, install the new ROM,
re-install <i>Titanium Backup</i>, and tell it to restore everything from SD.
When it's finished, not only will all of your applications and settings will
be restored, but so will system components like your configured WiFi access
points, MMS/SMS, call log, etc. Since you are using <i>Titanium Backup</i> to do
the backup and restore (rather than some tool built into whatever ROM you were
using), you can do this between totally different ROMs without worrying about
compatibility issues. You can even do it between different devices simply by
switching the SD card.
<p>
In addition to the standard backup functions, the donation version of
<i>Titanium Backup</i> has a number of other tools which are very helpful for
the Android hacker. It can "freeze" applications, which allows you to keep the
package installed on the system, but otherwise have Android completely ignore
it. This allows you to test if a particular package is safe to remove before
actually deleting it (of particular use when trying to remove carrier or
manufacturer installed applications). It also includes a tool called "Market
Doctor" which will run through all of your applications and verify they are
properly registered in the Android Market. There are other little fixes and
features too, like a faster shell (to execute file operations quicker), and
the ability to have multiple backups per application.
<p>
The donation process for <i>Titanium Backup's</i> is a bit different than most
applications; basically, you download the free application, then go to the
author's website and select how much you would like to donate. $3.99 gets you a
license key, but you can select a few higher donation increments if you wish.
After donation, you will get a license file that unlocks the advanced features
of the application and registers it to your name and email address. While you
can get away with using the free version, I would really suggest donating to
unlock the advanced tools, <i>especially</i> if you intend on doing any sort of
ROM modification.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While <i>Titanium Backup</i> is an excellent tool
for power users, it lacks obvious appeal to the average user.
<i>Wireless Tether</i> on the other hand, is a root-only application that
pretty much anyone can get behind. While Android 2.2 introduced a wireless
tether function, the carriers have decided to lock it up and force users into
additional fees to use a function built right into the OS. But with
<i>Wireless Tether</i>, you can share your Android device's 3G cellular
connection with multiple clients over Bluetooth and Ad-Hoc WiFi <i>without</i>
having to sign up for any additional services from your carrier.
<p>
This is somewhat of a grey area in terms of legality, as the use of this
application more than likely breaks your carrier's TOS. Additionally, if you
intend on making serious use of the tethering function (I.E. using it as a
primary Internet connection on your computer), there is a good chance your
carrier will eventually catch on. But if you only want to use the tethering
function occasionally and don't mind living a little dangerously,
<i>Wireless Tether</i> is the answer.
<p>
While the use of this application may be questionable, one thing is not:
<i>Wireless Tether</i> is one of the best designed and polished applications in
the Android Market, and may very well be the best free application available.
There is an incredible amount of customization built into the networking
aspect of the application, letting you setup relatively complex networks to
suit almost any need. You can setup access controls, enable encryption, change
IP subnets, etc. The UI itself is also exceptionally well designed, and the
multitude of notification options (for things like new client connections) is a
really nice touch.
<p>
However, <i>Wireless Tether</i> is not without it's flaws. Battery life while
tethering is absolutely horrendous; this is about as hard as you can possibly
work an Android device, 3G and WiFi will both be going at full tilt (remember,
this is something that would never occur under normal circumstances) and the
processor is going to be running fairly hard to handle IP forwarding and NAT.
You won't get long on a charge running at this rate, and even if you are
plugged in, don't be surprised if your device starts getting rather warm (hence
the temperature monitor on-screen).
<p>
The other issue, at least on most devices, is that the WiFi hardware can only
be put into Ad-Hoc mode. Which means that, unless you are running one of the
few devices that have hardware support for Master mode (at the time of this
writing, I am only aware of the HTC EVO 4G), your client devices will have to
support getting online through an Ad-Hoc connection. If you only intend on
sharing your connection with full-fledged computers, that's fine. But most
other devices (PDAs, game consoles, Internet enabled set-top boxes, etc) will
not even attempt to connect to the Internet when they see an Ad-Hoc network.
<p>
With slight technical issues (which are both attributed to valid hardware
limitations) and legality aside, <i>Wireless Tether</i> is one of the best
examples of what rooted Android device's are capable of. If you are on the
fence about rooting your device and need a compelling reason to take the
plunge, or maybe just want to show off to your iFriends, this application is
it.

authenticated to. Of particular interest is the fact that you can run
<i>Shark</i> while your device is tethering (like when using <i>Wireless
Tether</i> or the Android 2.2+ built in tethering function). This opens up the
possibility of doing mobile man-in-the-middle attacks against WiFi clients;
simply setup your device for WiFi tethering using a SSID like "PublicWiFi",
start up <i>Shark</i>, and see what you catch.
<p>
Since <i>Shark</i> is built on tcpdump, it saves all of the logged data in
standard PCAP files. These files can be read in your protocol analyzer of
choice (such as WireShark), but Elviss has also written a companion tool
called
<a class="thumbnail" href="#thumb"><i>Shark Reader</i><span><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chs=135x135&chl=market://details?id=lv.n3o.sharkreader" /></span></a>
designed to let you read PCAP files right on the device. <i>Shark Reader</i>
follows the same minimalistic design ideals as <i>Shark</i>, but again, gets
the job done well enough.
<p>
While these two applications are hardly a replacement for a laptop running
WireShark, it is an interesting example of what can be done with mobile devices
if the user thinks out of the box a bit.
