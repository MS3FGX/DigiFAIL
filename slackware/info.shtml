<h1>Slackware Linux</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An ISO for Slackware Linux was the first thing I
downloaded when I <i>finally</i> got broadband at my house. For a year or so
prior to that, I had wanted desperately to try out Linux and had been reading
about every distribution I could, preparing myself for the day I would finally
have the bandwidth to make my dream a reality. At the time I was considering
what I still consider the "Big Three": Slackware, Debian, Gentoo. I consider
these the core distributions because so many other distributions are based on
them or borrow concepts from them. Which of course is not surprising, as these
are 3 of the very first successful GNU/Linux distributions; naturally upstarts
would try and mimic them as closely as possible in their perceived strengths.
<p>
I finally decided on Slackware Linux because it seemed to be the closest to
what my idea of an operating system should be. After downloading that very
first ISO, I can honestly say that the course of my entire life changed. Linux
became not only one of my biggest hobbies, but indeed an increasingly large
part of my professional life. I have no doubt it my mind that, had I chosen a
different distribution to download, I would not today have the same level of
knowledge of the Linux kernel or the GNU system. While I understand that not
everyone wants (or even needs) to understand the low-level workings of their
operating system, I strongly suggest that anyone who <i>does</i> take a look at
starting their journey with Slackware. While distributions like Ubuntu
certainly have the limelight today (and not without good reason), Slackware
will always have it's place, and it's fans, in the Linux world.
<p>
<h1>Involvement with Slackware</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I am not officially involved with the
Slackware Linux project, I have from time to time submitted suggestions and
fixes upstream which have been implemented in the stable releases; such as the
Bluetooth implementation used in Slackware 12.2 - 13.0.
<p>
<h1>The Goods</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have put up for public download both my Slackware
package repository (all of the packages I have built for my own personal use
organized by stable Slackware release versions), and a mirror of Slackware's
-current development branch. I am not sure that my upload bandwidth is quite up
to the task of being a serious mirror for many people, but I imagine it should
be pretty quick for those in the Northeast US.
<p>
In the near future I also hope to put up my SlackBuilds directory which is what
was used to build all of the binary packages I have up. I need to do a little
maintenance with them and figure out a way to easily share them publicly while
not hindering my work-flow, as my build machine is not currently accessible by
the Internet. In the meantime, binary packages are what most people are looking
for anyway, though feel free to contact me if there is a specific SlackBuild
you would like and I can send it along.
