<h1>What was it?</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Back when I was still actually using the original
Xbox, I became increasingly unhappy with the tangle of wires that was always
involved when storing or getting out the controllers. There were third party
products available to add wireless capability to the console, but by this
time the 360 was already on the market, and I couldn't help but feel silly
with an ugly little box connected to the front of my console.
<p>
One day, I decided to take apart one of these third party external wireless
controller units and try to integrate it into the console itself. Having
previously done work inside the Xbox, I knew the thing was a beast with
plenty of space inside to mount additional components.
<p>
The finished product was rather poor, but I would stress this was one of
my very first "organized" projects, so I don't feel that bad about the
amateurish attempt. Also note that I had to recently pull the console
apart to take the images you see here, as I didn't take any pictures
while originally working on it. You will have to use your imagination a
bit with this one.
<h1>Preparing the Receiver</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/fails/xboxmod2.jpg" alt="Logitech Controller" /></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To start this project, I went to my local
GameStop and picked up a used "Logitech Cordless Attack Controller" for
about $18. The Internet told me this was the best wireless controller for
the Xbox, and the receiver seemed small enough that I could reasonably
fit it inside of the console once properly stripped down.
<p>
To start with, I took it out of it's plastic case, removed the memory card
connectors, and desoldered the lead coming into the board (remember when I
said you needed to use your imagination?). This left me with a flat PCB that
was only a few inches wide, though admittedly in an odd horseshoe shape. The
PCB had an SMD LED on one leg of the horseshoe, which I also removed (smashed).
<p>
Once everything was off the board, I got a scrap piece of CAT5e cable and
soldered the wires on one side to where the controller and LED leads originally
connected. This let me run both the controller signals and the status LED power
down the same wire to a remote location (I.E. the front of the console). I then
coated the wires in hot glue to make sure they didn't work themselves loose.
<p>

<p>
I think I mentioned this was an early work of mine...right?
<h1>Controller Interface</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OK, that is just a fancy way to say "soldered the
thing into the back of the controller port". Luckily the Xbox controller ports
are on easily removable little brackets, and the individual ports themselves
are easily pulled open to reveal the pins from the rear. It was only a matter
of soldering the new wires from the CAT5e onto the existing wires. In addition,
I jammed a little green LED into the space between the inner wall of the
controller socket and the internal connector, which was obviously attached to
the two wires from the SMD LED pad. This would give me a nice little status
light that would be invisible unless lit. Finally, another generous
application of hot glue (I must have really liked this stuff when I was
younger).

<p>
In the following image, you can see the controller port module installed
back into the front panel of the Xbox, with the new CAT5e wiring going to the
left of the image, and the original controller leads going towards the right:

<h1>Installing the Receiver</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All that remained now was actually finding a spot
inside of the console to mount the receiver PCB, and safely run the wires back
to it. I was exceptionally fortunate in this case, as the PCB fit perfectly
behind the DVD drive, sitting right on top of the Ethernet port. I then simply
routed the CAT5e from the front panel to the location of the receiver, which
again proved very easy thanks to the ridiculous size of the Xbox hardware.
<p>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/fails/xboxmod6.jpg" alt="Wide shot" /></span>
<p>
When the Xbox was put back together, the only part of the whole installation
that was even visible was the very top of the receiver PCB:

<h1>So what happened?</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, first of all, it certainly <i>did work</i>.
But there were two rather major problems with that project that forced me to
put it into the "Fail" pile, both of which are embarrassingly obvious in
hindsight, but as I said, I was quite young here.
<p>
The biggest problem was that the Faraday-cage case they have on the Xbox
almost completely blocked the signal of the controller, so range was very.
very short, around 3 to 5 feet. To make matters worse, the close proximity
of the receiver board to the optical drive and IDE cable meant that the
controller would suffer vicious interference whenever a game would load
either from DVD or the HDD. This could be confirmed by simply looking at
the activity LED I added, it would flash madly whenever the console was
doing anything but sitting idle.
<p>
Slightly less of a concern was the fact that the front controller port
was now useless for real wired controllers, as the Xbox couldn't
understand two controllers connected to the same port.
<p>
Both of these issues could be fixed easily enough if one was so inclined.
The poor range could be remedied (or at least improved upon) by running a shielded
wire outside of the metal casing of the Xbox to a small antenna mounted to
the back. Wired controllers could be supported by the use of a relay-type
device to switch between the different connected devices depending on the
open or closed state of the sense wire in the controller port.
<p>
While these improvements are easy enough to implement, I no longer use the Xbox
so I have no reason to do so personally. Even though I technically consider
this project a failure in it's current form, I do take some pride in the fact
that, to my knowledge, this is the only documented modification of its type
for the Xbox.
