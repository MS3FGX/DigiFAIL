<h1>Foreword</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The following is <i>Introduction to Chrome OS</i>, an
introduction to Google's Chrome OS published on page 6 of <i>2600</i> issue
28:3.
<p>
This is a very short article that I wrote up after using the
<a href="/hardware/cr48.shtml">CR-48</a> I received as part of the Chrome OS test.
While my articles are usually very technical, this one was more of an opinion piece
about Google's plans for Chrome OS. Admittedly, this one went a little negative
towards the end, which is somewhat of a first for me; I usually try to keep pretty
neutral in these sort of things.

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
As Chrome OS is a moving target, constantly evolving and changing, there is no
guarantee that the information contained herein will still be 100% accurate,
or for that matter even relevant, by the time you read this. It's even possible
the Chrome OS project will have crashed and burned before these words make it
to paper. Still, as a matter of historical record, I will describe in the
following pages my early experience with Chrome OS as both a piece of
technology and a new concept in computing.
<h1>What is Chrome OS?</h1>
Chrome OS is an experiment by Google to see if the average users' day to day
computing needs could be met (or perhaps even exceeded) by pushing all of
their applications and personal files into the "Cloud". By the way, before we
get too far into this, let's clear up one thing from the start; the "Cloud" is
just the Internet. So for the rest of this article I am going to dispense with
the marketing buzzword and just call it that, if it's all the same to you.
<p>
Anyway, the concept of putting all of our documents and programs on a remote
server is certainly nothing new. The mass market is already familiar with using
the Internet as an application and data storage platform with immensely popular
services like Facebook and Dropbox; and of course the very concept of the local
machine being nothing more than a terminal that connects to a network of more
powerful machines goes all the way back to the original mainframe computers. In
fact, you could even make the argument that putting all of our assets onto
server's out of our control is a step backwards in computing, something that
the community once fought hard to break free from.
<p>
Issues of freedom and privacy aside (don't worry, we will be back to that
shortly), Google does make a strong case for the Chrome OS concept. The fact of
the matter is, the vast majority of average computer users don't do a whole lot
on their machines other than access web-based services like GMail, Facebook,
Twitter, etc. If we go along with the claim made in some of the Chrome OS
promotional videos, that the average computer user spends 90% of their time in
the web browser, it's logical that a machine which has only a web browser
could fulfill the majority of their needs.
<p>
The startup tutorial that plays when you first login to the system also makes
frequent references to the idea of a "Steamroller Attack", which is how Google
describes the sudden and unavoidable destruction of a Chrome OS device. It goes
on to explain that, since everything is stored online, the local machine itself
is nothing more than a disposable portal through which you access their
services. Therefore, the destruction or otherwise loss of the machine isn't a
problem, since you can return right where you left off with a new unit.
<p>
But theory is just that, and without a real world test there is no way to be
sure if the Chrome OS concept holds up with actual users. Accordingly, Google
announced they would be mailing out test machines loaded with the current build
of Chrome OS to lucky applicants.
<p>
I would like to think that somebody from Google looked me up and decided that
my website and published works were so well written and researched that they
simply had to award me one of these new prototype machines, but realistically I
am sure it was just the luck of the draw. In any event, I now have in my
possession Google's idea of the future, so let's take a look at it.
<h1>The Hardware</h1>
As the hardware itself (known as the CR-48) is a reference device, and almost
certainly will never see a commercial release in it's current form, I won't
dwell too long on it here. But it is worth a mention as it does echo many of
the same ideals of Chrome OS itself, and regardless of how close hardware
manufacturers decide to follow it's example, it does say a lot about how Google
envisions computers of the future.
<p>
If you asked me to picture what a mobilized, 21st century version of a
mainframe terminal would be like, the CR-48 would be it. It's simple, sleek,
perfectly suited for it's task, and at the same time wholly forgettable. It is
a disposable computer if there ever was one, completely devoid of bells,
whistles, or branding. There is only a single USB port, a VGA connector for an
external monitor, and an SD reader. Even the original ASUS Eee 701 netbooks had
more connectivity options.
<p>
The untrained eye may look at the CR-48 and assume that Google was simply
trying to put out the cheapest machine they could for the purposes of the
Chrome OS test, but a glance at what's under the hood tells another story. The
CR-48 is powered by Intel's Atom N455 processor, paired with 2GB of DDR3 RAM
and a 16GB SSD. In addition to the expected WiFi, it has an integrated 3G modem
with free data service of up to 100MB per month, and Bluetooth 2.1. At the time
of this writing, the closest consumer netbook I could find with similar
specifications was over $400, and even then, didn't have as large a screen or
3G.
<h1>The Software</h1>
Chrome OS is an incredibly simple platform from a software standpoint. It is
literally just a standard GNU/Linux system that boots directly into the Chrome
browser.
<p>
Of course, the build of Chrome OS that ships on the CR-48 is very far from
completion, and it could be that things will change significantly before the
mass market gets their hands on it. But as it stands, I am struck by how
absolutely normal the Linux system is. I was expecting something similar to
Android, where the system powers a heavily customized and stripped down
userland with the Linux kernel. In Chrome OS, the only thing the system is
missing to be a standard Linux desktop is a proper window manager and local
applications.
<p>
There are however some added security features not normally found on desktop
Linux. For example, the /home directory and all removable devices are mounted
with the "noexec" option, which means it isn't (normally) possible to execute
binaries stored on these volumes. This effectively prevents any executable
programs from being run on the machine unless they were included in Chrome OS.
<p>
If you are the tinkering type, which if you are reading this you likely are,
you will probably want to put Chrome OS into Developer Mode. Developer Mode
enables some nice features like "crosh" (Chrome OS's debug shell), and Linux
terminal access. On the CR-48 there is a physical switch under the battery
cover that puts the machine into Developer Mode, but the Chrome OS
documentation seems to indicate other machines may have different methods to
enable this special mode. 
<h1>The Experience</h1>
Part of the agreement you have to accept when applying for a CR-48 is that you
will use the machine as your primary computer for awhile and send as much input
back to Google as you can through the built-in feedback system. I complied with
the agreement and spent a week using, or perhaps more accurately attempting to
use, the CR-48 as my main computer. The experience was more or less what I
expected, and certainly made for an interesting experiment.
<p>
I should start off by saying that I am clearly not the intended audience for
Chrome OS, and I would go so far as to say neither are the vast majority of
2600 readers. Chrome OS in it's current form is simply not suitable for anyone
who does more than browse the Internet and use social networking sites. But
as it just so happens, those people are actually in the majority, so I don't
know that the situation is a problem for Google.
<p>
I found that by enabling the aforementioned Developer Mode and getting access
to the Linux terminal I was able to improve upon the situation immensely. From
Linux I was able to do things like mount USB storage devices and run X over
SSH, which let me display the output of graphical Linux applications in
Chrome OS's WM. Being able to Alt+Tab into Firefox had a fun irony to it, but
more importantly it let me run some graphical applications which simply don't
have a Chrome OS parallel yet. Of course, this is cheating, and the average
user wouldn't be in Developer Mode, and certainly won't know enough about the
Linux command line environment to mount his USB flash drive.
<p>
Which brings us to Chrome OS "Apps"; surely, missing functionality in the core
OS could be supplemented with third-party applications? As it turns out, no.
<p>
As Chrome OS is built on the principle that most users simply want to access
web-based services, it's idea of applications are, accordingly, things that you
are able to do from within the browser itself. But if the service is held
entirely on the Internet, what exactly needs to be installed on the local
Chrome OS machine? Well, just what you would think, actually. A bookmark.
<p>
That's right, as of this writing, the majority of Chrome OS "Apps" are simply
bookmarks. Google is so hell-bent on proving that the Internet is an
applications platform that they have gone so far as to trick the user into
thinking they are installing an application when they are really just making
a bookmark to an existing website. It's really rather ridiculous, the Web Store
(where Chrome OS users go to download and purchase Chrome OS Apps) is scarcely
more than a repository of bookmarks that the user can search through and rate.
Oh, and purchase too; you can literally sell bookmarks on the Chrome OS Web
Store.
<p>
The closest you can get to real applications on Chrome OS are Chrome
Extensions, which are simply add-ons to the Chrome browser itself. These vary
from the handy to the inane, but on the whole they are all very simplistic.
There is only so much a browser add-on can do, after all. These are also the
same Extensions you can get on the desktop version of Chrome, which means none
of them are really making use of Chrome OS's APIs or unique features.
<p>
Even though I was faced with what seemed like intolerable limitations, I
carried on with my duty to run Chrome OS and give Google feedback. I found that
after a few days I really did begin to adapt to a browser-only computer. I even
started to use more of Google's services, like Google Talk, since they were so
tightly integrated into Chrome OS itself; surely part of Google's larger plan
with Chrome OS. Everything was going relatively well, until the night the
Internet went out.
<p>
I was working on the CR-48, and when I clicked on the GMail App I found it was
unable to load. I switched over to a tab that had Google open and tried a
search, and sure enough that failed as well. As a Comcast Internet customer,
I am well accustomed to the Internet going out at random, and a quick glance
over at the router showed that this was once again the case. My first instinct
was to simply work on something that didn't need the Internet, such as writing
this article. So I clicked on the Google Docs App so I could start 
writing...and then it hit me.
<p>
A wave of 21st century Lovecraftian horror grew over me as I realized that,
without the Internet, the device in front of me was completely useless. Write
a document? Not without Google Docs. Play music? Can't store anything on the
local machine. Play a game? Surely you jest. Write software? Hell, I had a hard
enough time with that when the Internet was still working.
<p>
It was a sobering wakeup call that the device sitting in front of me was most
definitely not a computer in the sense I have become accustomed to. It also
reminded me that, while the Internet is certainly a very large part of what
people do on their computers, it is assuredly not the only thing they do. Not
being able to write a document because the Internet is out is already absurd,
but without the Internet I couldn't even get access to any of my files, which
is absolutely unacceptable.
<h1>Cloud Conundrum</h1>
The night the Internet went out was a turning point for me and my CR-48, and
not simply because I couldn't write a document. With Chrome OS, I couldn't
even get access to my own files unless I was on a decent Internet connection.
Which brings up a very interesting question: if I can't get to my files when
I want them, are they still really my files? If not, who's are they?
<p>
As far as impossibly large corporations go, Google has done a decent job of
keeping itself on the side of good. I don't really believe that Google
themselves would somehow claim ownership of my documents, or allow a third
party to access them in their entirety. But, Google makes it's money by selling
targeted advertisements, and most of us are already aware of some of the ways
Google matches the user with the ad.
<p>
By signing up for GMail, for example, you agree to let Google pick keywords out
of your messages and use those to show relevant advertisements. My wife and
infant daughter recently got into a car accident, and while I was writing an
email to friends and family explaining what had happened, I noticed an
advertisement for a sale at "Babies R Us" on new car seats. Many people, maybe
even most, would let something like that go without a second thought. But the
experience left me troubled, and I have to admit I am worried about that sort
of technology being applied to my full text documents.
<p>
It isn't hard to imagine advertisers using keywords generated from text
documents created with Google Docs in new and even more intrusive ways. Typing
up a letter of resignation? Perhaps you would be interested in a career
consultation? Writing a journal entry about some stress you are having at work?
Perhaps you need suicide counseling!
<p>
Most of us have already been lulled into complacency by Google. If you aren't
one of the millions of users that have a GMail account, you have still probably
used Google's ubiquitous search engine. Even if you have avoided using Google's
services directly, the sites you access online have surely been using Google
Analytics to gather information about their visitors' browsing. By using
Google's software, directly or indirectly, we have silently agreed to let
personalized advertisements be generated for us. But at least it has always
been a choice; with your own computer you could make a concious decision to
avoid and block all of Google's software and replace it with alternatives.
<p>
With Chrome OS, that choice is largely removed. The computer is no longer a
possession of the user, it's importance as an object has been taken out of the
equation. In the Chrome OS model, the computer is simply a portal through
which Google can push advertisements with greater efficiency than ever before.
Purchasing a Chrome OS device is akin to signing away your online identity to
Google; some will balk at the prospect, but many more will accept the terms
just to get a low cost computer. Only time will tell which group made the right
choice.
<h1>Beyond the CR-48</h1>
As I write this, third parties have finally started announcing their own
Chrome OS devices intended for the mass market. These new machines are being
referred to collectively as "Chromebooks", which seems to indicate that the
focus (at least for now) is to keep Chrome OS relegated to netbooks only.
Google has mentioned a desktop Chrome OS device being in the works, but I
imagine it's release greatly depends on Chrome OS's success with mobile
devices.
<p>
Since I have been in the Chrome OS pilot group since day one, I would like to
think I have a fairly good idea where the Chrome OS project is going, and how
it will get there. But we are only a few weeks out from when the first official
Chromebooks are supposed to start shipping, and I honestly don't see how the
build of Chrome OS running on my CR-48 is ready for public consumption. So many
basic functions are missing or broken, it's hard to believe Google would risk
such a poor first impression with their initial wave of devices. If a bad first
wave was enough to permanently damage the reputation of Windows Vista, I can
only imagine it's effect on a fledgeling OS that is already pushing the
boundaries of what the consumer expects from a computer.
<p>
One of the key elements of the Chrome OS initiative going forward is the fact
that the devices will be made available to enterprise and educational customers
as a monthly lease. Enterprise users will pay $28 per month, while educational
leases will cost $20. Both require a three year contract, which includes
hardware warranty and technical support. This is an extremely aggressive
pricing scheme, and it's pretty clear that this is where Google thinks Chrome
OS is most likely to succeed. I would be inclined to agree that schools and
businesses are good candidates for low-cost subscription based computing;
though I am not so convinced either of those groups will be too keen to sign
up for a three year contract with a machine that still can't perform simple
tasks such as printing a document.
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
As I said in the opening of this article, Chrome OS is a rapidly moving target,
so I hesitate to make any judgement calls about it in terms of functionality
or maturity. Indeed, I have had to go back to edit and remove parts of this
article as I was writing it, as Chrome OS goes through periods where updates
are pushed out daily.
<p>
But some parts of Chrome OS are not going to change, as they are not a fault
of the software but instead a conceptional limitation; Chrome OS is a platform
for consumers, not creators. You won't be developing software, rendering video,
or mixing audio on Chrome OS machine. Even though there are some simplistic
attempts at those sort of applications, these are tasks which just don't lend
themselves to this style of computing.
<p>
What's more, you will never escape Google's grasp when using a Chrome OS
computer, no matter how far the software is developed. At the end of the day,
the goal of Chrome OS is to push more targeted advertisements to the user, so
don't expect an option to "Opt Out" of Google's services and run the machine
on your own terms (unless you want to wipe it and install your own OS).
<p>
As it stands, possible privacy issues notwithstanding, Chrome OS machines do
make a lot of sense for schools or businesses where everyone needs to have a
computer to access the Internet, send email, and do basic word processing. On
the other hand, I cannot fathom an individual purchasing a Chrome OS computer
for anything near the cost of a more traditional system.
