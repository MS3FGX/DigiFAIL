<h1>GameFAQs Guides</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I was a younger man, I spent many an hour
working on guides for which I dutifully submitted to
<a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com" target="_blank">GameFAQs</a>. I wouldn't go
so far as to say this time was wasted (after all, I have received untold
numbers of emails thanking me for each of them), but I do feel that they are
slightly out of my current realm of interest. Still, as I intended DigiFAIL
to be a collection of all of my work I feel obligated to put them up, even if
it is just for the sake of completion. They certainly don't need the exposure,
as collectively these documents are mirrored on more sites than any of my other
projects could ever hope to be.
<p>
Unfortunately, GameFAQs had (and may still have, I have not been on the site in
a few years) a strict set of guidelines for all of their submissions; one of
which being that no document could be over 80 characters wide. As such, all of
my guides were written and formatted to exactly 80 columns. I experimented with
expanding this a bit for the site, but it was simply too frightening a prospect
to seriously consider.
<p>
As such, I will not put the actual text of each document on this page, but
rather a small foreword for each. The full ASCII files for all of these guides
are available in the "Text" section of the
<a href="/misc/downloads.shtml">Downloads</a> page.
<h1>DS Networking Guide</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/text/guides2.jpg" alt="Nintendo DS" /></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <i>"Nintendo DS Wireless Networking Guide"</i>,
was my life from 2005 into 2008; it is a massive document that quickly got
far, far, away from the scope of the original work. It started as a simple
guide which would document the various WiFi settings and functions of the newly
released Nintendo DS. However it quickly became an obsession, and I began
branching out into completely new territory as I saw more and more people fail
to grasp the ins and outs of wireless technology. I started documenting ways of
sharing an Internet connection out from a desktop PC, which expanded to cover
all three major operating systems. I then started documenting the different
ways to secure a wireless network in relation to the DS. So on and so on.
<p>
The main reason I continued development for so long past the original goal was
the tremendous amount of support I got from people who read the Guide and got
some use out of it. I received hundreds of emails about the Guide, ranging from
the expected requests for help to people suggesting I take up a career in
writing technical documentation. I received assistance from a number of people
as well, who were listed among the "Credits" or at least the "Version
Information" ChangeLog.
<p>
All told, the <i>"Nintendo DS Wireless Networking Guide"</i> clocks in at
36,988 words and has been downloaded over 100,000 times on GameFAQs alone (I
have long since lost track of how many sites mirror it). But even with as large
as it is, there could still be additions. For example the Guide does not cover
the newer DSi system, which adds WPA support and vastly improved Internet
connectivity functions. Though I think somebody else is going to have to handle
that one...
<h1>Wii Networking Guide</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/text/guides3.jpg" alt="Nintendo Wii" /></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <i>"Nintendo Wii Networking Guide"</i> is very
similar to it's DS counterpart. So similar in fact that I was initially worried
it would not get accepted due to about 80% of it being identical to the DS
version. I will admit it, I only did it because submitters on GameFAQs were
often judged by the disk space their contributions used, so by duplicating the
already massive DS Guide, I could get myself some easy e-cred. Of course, the
Wii Guide does cover things that the DS one doesn't, most notably the addition
of Ethernet support and all of the things that entails (such as much easier
ways of sharing an existing Internet connection with it).
<p>
The Wii was also a paradigm shift of sorts for Nintendo, as they began to
seriously persue various forms of digital distribution on their home consoles.
With the Wii, users could not only download their favorite classic games, but
also get information like news and weather downloaded automatically into their
consoles, they could even surf the web with the included Opera-based web
browser. The up-side to all of this is that even more people wanted to get
their Wii's online than they did their DS's, which comparatively had very
little in the way of online functionality (until the DSi that is, but that's
another story entirely).
<p>
The <i>"Nintendo Wii Networking Guide"</i> is a strong second in terms of
overall popularity, which is simply because the
<i>"Nintendo DS Wireless Networking Guide"</i> had a large head-start. Not bad
for a copy-and-paste job, if I do say so myself.
<h1>Battlefield Strategy</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/text/guides4.jpg" alt="Battlefield Cover" /></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone who knows me will tell you that one of the
greatest passions in my life is playing Battlefield. I have logged hundreds of
hours into every game in the series, starting with 1942 and continuing right on
to the newest releases. There is just something about these games which works
so well, even when I am doing bad in a match I still want to keep coming back
for more.
<p>
<i>"Battlefield: Modern Combat"</i> was the first Battlefield game for home
consoles, launching on the PS2 and Xbox (with a vastly superior Xbox 360 build
coming a few years later, and yes, I have both versions), which was great for
me since I hate PC games anyway. Out of all the games in the series, I would
have to say that I spent the most with this one, simply because I could come
home, boot the PS2, and get right into a helicopter. DirectX be damed.
<p>
After a few hundred hours logged, I started to see the maps as real
battlefields, visualizing the movements of enemy combatants based on the
geographical layout of the region and the outcomes of past engagements. Once I
began to notice and react to these trends, my game got noticeably improved. I
started telling my teammates about some of these patterns, and began giving
them mission briefings before we started the match, predicting which points
would be captured in which order, and which ones would be the most difficult to
attack and defend at any given point in the battle. I even started to analyze
the performance of the various vehicles in the game, and could identify the
weak spots or shortcomings of a particular vehicle on it's approach, giving my
squad the competitive edge in the engagement.
<p>
Eventually I decided to start documenting all of the things I noticed, and the
result was the <i>"Battlefield: Modern Combat Online Strategy Guide"</i>. This
document aimed to cover everything I learned about combat in this game, from
the most likely sniper positions on each map to how to best deal with an enemy
tank.
<p>
I say <i>aimed</i>, because I never finished it. After working on it for
months, I eventually didn't have the energy to continue. I noticed that a lot
of the strategies became repetitive, and the fact of the matter was that I got
much more detailed than necessary on a lot of aspects. Me being obsessive? Who
knew?
<p>
I did finish enough of the guide to publish it online, and as a matter of fact
the version hosted here on DigiFAIL is a bit more complete than the versions
floating around on other sites, so we can consider this one a bit of an
exclusive.
<h1>Tomcat Alley Guide</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/text/guides5.jpg" alt="Tomcat Alley Cover" /></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You remember this game, don't you? Well? No, of
course you don't. That is because very few people in the world gave this game
enough attention to warrant remembering it any longer than absolutely
necessary, and that includes it's developers (more on that in a second).
<p>
<i>"Tomcat Alley"</i> is a product of a very awkward phase in video game
development. SEGA had just introduced their SEGA CD console, marking (sort of)
a quantum leap in game technology. SEGA gave developers the relatively
unlimited storage capacity of CDs and the processing power necessary to play
full motion video. The problem was, not a whole else changed about the console,
so basically you had the ability to play movies tacked on to a regular SEGA
Genesis. Accordingly, that is what most SEGA CD games ended up being, and
<i>"Tomcat Alley"</i> is a prime example of this long-dead game genre.
<p>
Essentially, <i>"Tomcat Alley"</i> is just a bunch of videos of F-14's zipping
around the sky and with poor actors wincing their way through an equally
underwhelming script. These video clips are played in different order depending
on what you do during the brief times you are able to actually select something
on the screen. For example, when engaging an enemy fighter you need to move
your targeting reticle onto the plane flying around in the video. If you hit
the plane, a clip of a jet exploding will play, otherwise a video of your
missile missing and the enemy plane circling back around you will play. So
technically you do control the game, but it is more like a chose your own
adventure than an interactive air combat game; in fact you never even fly the
plane, you just shoot the weapons (for which their can obviously be only two
possible outcomes).
<p>
You may be wondering why anyone would possibly write a guide for a game that
is essentially the same as hitting the chapter select on a DVD. That is an
excellent question, and one which I don't really have an answer for. I figured
I might as well document the order the missions progress in, and how many
enemies you could expect to face at a certain waypoint.
<p>
However, there was at least one part of the game that needed legitimate
documentation, the secret mission. One day I noticed on the back of the box
that it advertised having 7 missions, while I had only ever done 6. I went
online and tried to find some information about this hidden mission, but not
surprisingly there was very little online in regards to this game, let alone
any secrets it may hold. After searching for weeks I eventually tracked down
the game's developers "The Code Monkeys", and sent them an email about it. A
few weeks later they responded that nobody on the staff could remember much
about it. Amazing.
<p>
So I put the guide up as it was with 6 missions, and made a note at the end
about looking for information about the 7th mission. Within a few months I had
received a few emails about it with hazy details, and then finally received
the exact requirements for triggering the mission from somebody who managed to
do it accidentally. I was then able to play through the mission and document
what happens for anyone who manages to get there.
<p>
While I don't think anyone who grew up on the modern generation of game
consoles could possibly enjoy <i>"Tomcat Alley"</i>, it will always hold a
special place in my heart. I remember the first time I put the disc in and saw
real live actors on the screen, I was simply blown away. Keep in mind that the
game console I was playing on before I got the SEGA CD was an Atari 2600, so
the jump was a bit of a shock to say the least. I do occasionally wonder if we
will ever see such a huge leap in interactive entertainment in the future as
we did in the early days, and if so, will our current games eventually be as
ridiculous to us then as <i>"Tomcat Alley"</i> is now? Yeah, probably not.
<h1>The X-Files Game Guide</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/text/guides6.jpg" alt="X-Files Cover" /></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If <i>"Tomcat Alley"</i> represents everything that
was wrong with the FMV point-and-click genre, then <i>"The X-Files Game"</i>
could easily be considered it's antithesis. This game is one of the last major
entries into the genre before it sulked away into a niche, and it is
interesting to see just how far the technology had come; only to get utterly
squashed by the 3D powerhouses that would soon end the need for live actors in
video games.
<p>
<i>"The X-Files Game"</i> is essentially an interactive episode of the show. In
fact, it even has an episode number and was written by the shows writers. While
it isn't in the X-Files mythology (I.E. nothing of importance to the overall
timeline or story occurs), it is still recognized as part of the series. If
that isn't enough of an incentive for fans of the series to play this game,
then I don't know what is.
<p>
Oh yeah, maybe it is because you don't play as either Agents Mulder or Scully,
and even when those characters do show up it is only for a few brief scenes.
Still, all of the principle actors from the series are here, and they give an
excellent performance that wouldn't be out of place in a regular episode.
<p>
The game itself I found very entertaining, both from the standpoint of the
story and how well it was all presented. Everything from the opening title
sequence to the font used in the credits (which roll by even as you are playing
the game, just like in the beginning of the show) is exactly the same as in the
series. If you are a fan of the <i>"X-Files"</i>, you are going to want to play
this game. Even the box is worth the purchase price, are you seeing how cool
that thing looks?
<p>
While the game was released for both the PC and PlayStation, my guide only
covers the PC version. I understand that the PlayStation version is missing
some content, and that the video quality is considerably reduced. The PC
version is a massive 7 discs (only 4 on PlayStation, that should tell you
something), and runs relatively well on modern computers. I wrote the guide
using WINE on Linux, but I included information on how to get it running under
recent releases of OS X and Windows as well.
