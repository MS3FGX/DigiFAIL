<h1>Supporting DigiFAIL</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything on this site has been done in my free time
because I found it either academically interesting or of practical use (alright, not so
much that second one). The goal has never been to make money off of any of this, but rather
to get the information out there so others will hopefully put it to use. So I've never
considered locking content up behind a donation or fee; everything on this site will always
be free (in terms of cost <i>and</i> freedom).
<p>
That said, people have from time to time have contacted me asking how they can
help support me in my various endeavours. I still want to stress that I'm not
in this for any kind of monetary gain, but I certainly will not refuse the goodwill
of those who've found my work useful to them.
<p>
Bellow are a few practical options on how you can help keep DigiFAIL interesting.
If you have a different idea in mind to help out, please feel free to
<a href="/misc/contact.html" style="color: #FF9C27" onClick="window.open('/misc/contact.html','Contact','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,width=500,height=515,left=250,top=150'); return false;">contact me so we can discuss it.</a>
<h3>PayPal Donations</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was easily the most requested option, and despite
the bad press it occasionally gets, most people seem more comfortable using PayPal
than anything else. The "Donate" button visible on every page of the site will
take you to PayPal, where you can make a donation of any size you wish.
<p>
All donations via this PayPal link go directly into research and development on my
various projects by default, but if you have something you'd specifically like me
to do with the money (such as buying a particular piece of hardware to try and add
support for it in one of my software projects), then please let me know.
<h3>Buy My Book</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've recently published the eBook
<i>"Inside the Open Source Mind"</i>, where I conduct interviews with various open
source entrepreneurs, developers, and hackers. If you've read this much of my personal
site, there's a pretty good chance you'll be interested in what these guys have to say.
<p>
Beyond just the interviews, I also go into some detail on how I found out about each
person, and my thoughts on working with them during the interview process. Everyone I
spoke with during the creation of the book was exceptionally courteous and professional,
and I hope that in some small way, this book can help change the perception of open source
developers being antisocial egomaniacs.
<p>
<i>"Inside the Open Source Mind"</i> is available now for the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Open-Source-Mind-ebook/dp/B00CKEPZOA" target="_blank">Kindle</a>
and
<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/inside-the-open-source-mind-tom-nardi/1115221975" target="_blank">Nook</a>.
<h3>Hardware</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you have any unwanted devices or gadgets which you
think might fit into my interests, I would be glad to give them a good home
(and ideally, feature them on the site). Send me an email and we can work out the details.
