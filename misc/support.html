<h1>Supporting DigiFAIL</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From day one I was always sure about two things for
my site: I wanted to host it on my own hardware, and I never wanted to clutter
it up with advertisements I knew nobody would click on. I am still fully
committed to those goals, but the cost of running the site (both in hardware,
bandwidth, and my personal time) is starting to grow to the point where I could
use a little help. The following are a few ways in which you can help support
the continued development of DigiFAIL. If you would like more information, or
have an idea on how you might be able to help, please
<a href="/misc/contact.html" style="color: #FF9C27" onClick="window.open('/misc/contact.html','Contact','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,width=500,height=640,left=250,top=150'); return false;">contact me</a>.
<h1>Sponsorship</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do you have a company or website that would be
interested in sponsoring me and my work? Maybe you have a product you would
like me to review or perhaps incorporate into one of my projects? DigiFAIL is
an excellent opportunity to gain exposure in a market that is notoriously
difficult to reach with traditional advertisements. What good is a banner ad
when ~90% of the target audience is running AdBlock? Put your name or product
on DigiFAIL, and get guaranteed screen-time.
<h1>Donations</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I spend quite a bit of money on random bits of
electronic gadgets and items in the course of my various avenues of research
and development. If you have a piece of hardware you think I might be
interested in, a tool I may find useful, or even just a bit of electronic junk
that you don't know what else to do with; contact me and we can try to work
something out.
<p>
If you aren't in the position to donate physical objects, you can also donate
through PayPal. If you like my site enough to send even a dollar or two,
thanks; it really means a lot.
