<h1>First Act MI115</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recently I found a fully functioning First Act MI115 electronic
drum machine in the garbage, and thought it would be a fun toy for my 2 year old daughter.
Despite its (somewhat) professional look, this thing is really more of a kids toy than anything,
and certainly isn't suitable for real musical work. If I had to guess, I would bet that's why this
one ended up in the trash.
<p>
Whatever the reason, my daughter now had a new device to make a lot of noise with, and she was very
happy. But there was a pretty big problem with the drum kit that was driving me nuts. There was no
indication of whether or not the thing is turned on, and worse, pressing any button on the device
(other than the pads themselves, at least) turned it on.
<p>
With this thing taking 5 AAs at a clip (and no provision for external power), the first time my
daughter left it on overnight and killed the batteries, I was looking for a fix.
<h1>Looking Inside</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The idea seemed simple enough. Crack this thing open, turn it on, and
poke around with my meter until I found some traces giving out 3+ volts that I could use to drive
an LED mounted into the front panel.
<p>
As soon as I opened up the drum machine, I knew this was firmly in the territory of child's toy.
I haven't seen internal construction this lame in a long time, it looked like a cheap piece of
electronics from the 80's inside. The one thing I can say positively about the construction of
this device is that they did do a pretty good job labeling traces and wires, but that isn't
saying a whole lot. The mass of wires and explosion of hot glue definitely doesn't instil
confidence, and I don't know how long this could last with my daughter smashing it like a
lunatic everyday.
<p>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hacks/drumled_int.jpg" alt="MI115 Internals" /><br>This is just terrible.</span>
<p>
That little piece of PCB that looks like a reject from a $1 calculator is
apparently the brains of the whole operation, as everything else on the
board is passive. I figured this was the best place to look for a source of
steady voltage that would toggle nicely with the power state of the device,
so I started working my way along the edge connector that connects it to
the main board.

<h1>Making A Connection</h1>
Luckily, it didn't take too long. The third pad from the right gave me
a steady 4.5 volts when the drum was powered on, and nothing when off, and
the negative line coming in from the battery compartment was right in the
neighborhood.
<p>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hacks/drumled_solder.jpg" alt="Solder Connections" /><br></span>
<p>
I soldered two leads onto the pads, and rummaged through my parts box until
I found a suitably sized LED and a resistor close enough (around 200 &#8486)
to the appropriate values to keep it from exploding.
<p>
I trimmed the leads down on the LED, soldered the negative wire directly to
cathode side, and put the resistor and positive wire on the anode side.
<p>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hacks/drumled_led.jpg" alt="Back of LED" /><br></span>
<p>
I found a spot on the front of the drum which had a relatively smooth
backside, drilled through, then pushed the little LED assembly right in.
I drilled a small enough hole so the LED fit snuggly inside, but I thought
it was a good idea to judiciously apply some hot glue to the whole area
to make sure it didn't work its way back out. At any rate, it matched the
construction of the rest of the device.
<p>
Before reassembling the drum, I wrapped the exposed LED and resistor legs
with Kapton, so they were insulated from each other and anything else that
might decide to bump up against it inside of that shoddy enclosure.
<h1>Installed LED</h1>
In the end, the power LED modification worked very well. The location I drilled
for the LED was a bit too close to the membrane for the keypad, which meant
I had to install the LED in a slightly off-center way. The plastic also chipped
a bit when I was drilling through the front panel, which I didn't expect.
In hindsight I should have drilled through the back instead of the front,
which would have looked a little nicer.
<p>
Of course, none of those little details mattered much to my client this time
around. She was just glad to have her drum back, and I was glad to be able
to tell if she had left it on after her latest impromptu jam session.
