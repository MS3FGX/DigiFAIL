<h1>The Future</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Google's idea of the future, at least. The
Google CR-48 is considered a "reference device", which is to say that it isn't
a retail product itself, but rather the example of what future retail Chrome
OS devices should be like. The CR-48 will never go on sale to the public, and
is only available to testers selected at random by Google.
<p>
As you may have guessed, I was selected as one of those testers in December
2010, and have had the opportunity to test drive both Chrome OS and Google's
vision of what a netbook should be. This page will talk primarily about the
CR-48 as a hardware device, not Chrome OS itself. If you are interested in
Chrome OS, head over to the
<a href="/research/chrome.shtml">Chrome OS Research</a> page. You might also
want to check out the CR-48 related posts on my
<a href="http://blog.digifail.com/tagged/cr-48">Blog</a>.
<h1>First Impressions</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing that strikes you about the CR-48 is
how plain it looks, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Since the CR-48 is
not a retail device, it is blessedly free of the branding, stickers, and other
miscellaneous text that we have become so accustomed to on consumer electronics.
Every inch of the case is matte black with a soft, almost rubberized texture. It
reminds me of the old IBM Thinkpads.
<p>
The second thing you will probably notice is how simplistic the design is. The
CR-48 only has a VGA port, SD reader, headphone jack, USB port, and of course
the port for the charger. Even the original ASUS Eee 701 had more ports than
the CR-48. If the CR-48 was a normal netbook, this would be a concern, but with
Chrome OS, there is very little you are going to be doing with peripherals on
the local machine anyway, so loading it up with USB ports or card readers just
doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
<P>
The 12.1 inch display running at 1280x800 is easily visible and looks great.
The hinge action feels sturdy, as does the rest of the machine. While the CR-48
is a lightweight machine, it doesn't feel like it will break in your hands.
<p>
Speaking of hands, the CR-48 uses a "chicklet" style keyboard, which I can't
say I am a big fan of in general. While the keyboard is decent enough for the
sort of use this machine will be getting, I found it isn't quite as sensitive
as I would like; if I start typing too fast, the board seems to have trouble
registering all of my key presses.
<h1>Under the Hood</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the outside might give you the impression that
Google was just trying to push out a budget netbook as cheaply as possible, the
CR-48's hardware specifications tell another story. It is powered by an Intel
Atom N455 running at 1.66 GHz, with 2 GB of DDR3 RAM. Storage is provided by a
way-overkill 16 GB SSD.
<p>
But the CR-48's biggest assets are it's connectivity options. It features
dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1, and integrated 3G cellular modem
running on Verizon's CDMA network. The CR-48 comes with 100 MB fee data per
month for 24 months, but you can also sign up for daily and monthly data plans
if the 100 MB just isn't going to cut it for you.
<p>
If there is any component of the CR-48 that's lacking, it seems to be the GPU.
The Intel GMA chipset just doesn't seem to have the power to play HD videos
smoothly, and game performance (in what little games are available for Chrome
OS) is pretty rough. Even the most simplistic of games stutter and run at low
FPS. This might be something that gets addressed later in an updated driver,
but for the time being, video leaves a lot to be desired.
<h1>Practical Performance</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The CR-48 is a decently powerful machine for a
netbook, and Chrome OS is optimized to be as light and agile as possible. The
cumulative effect creates a machine that is exceptionally usable and
convenient.
<p>
It's clear that a lot of effort went into the CR-48's startup and power
management. Startup and shutdown are incredibly fast, but the CR-48's long
runtime battery and excellent power saving capabilities mean you won't
really have to shut it down very often anyway. You can leave the CR-48 in
standby mode for up to a week, and in practical use you can simply leave the
machine sleeping in between uses and just put it on charge every few days.
<p>
In terms of usability, I found that the trackpad takes awhile to adjust to.
The entire pad acts as a button, so clicking is performed by physically pushing
down on the pad. This works pretty well, and I have found myself missing the
feature on more traditional laptop trackpads. The trackpad also supports limited
multi-touch and gesture controls, though these are considerably less enjoyable.
<p>
Scrolling is pretty nice in theory: simply drag two fingers down anywhere on the
pad. But for some reason, this action is not always detected properly, and
sometimes doesn't seem to work while a webpage is still loading. I found in many
cases it was easier to simply use the scrollbars rather than wrestling with the
scroll gesture.
<p>
Right-clicking is performed by pushing the trackpad down with two fingers, an
operation that Chrome OS seems to have incredible difficulty detecting properly.
Even when the system detects that you have used two fingers to push the pad, most
of the time it will pick up the slight movement between your fingers as a motion
of the cursor, and take focus away from whatever you right-clicked.
<h1>Developer Switch</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/hardware/cr48_2.png" alt="Developer Switch" /></span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First and foremost, the CR-48 was designed to be a
research and development tool, not necessarily a consumer marketable device.
Accordingly, it has one feature which is unlikely to ever see the light of
day in a consumer-oriented Chrome OS device: the "Developer Switch". The
Developer Switch is a small switch hidden in the battery compartment of the
CR-48 which puts Chrome OS into Developer Mode. More information about
Developer Mode can be found on the
<a href="/research/chrome.shtml">Chrome OS Research</a> page.
<p>
To access the Developer Switch, simply shut the CR-48 down, remove the battery,
and look for a small piece of black plastic right next to the battery connector.
Removing this piece of plastic will uncover the Developer Switch. Move the
switch <i>towards</i> the battery connector to enable Developer Mode, then
replace the battery and power the CR-48 back on.
<p>
When booting back up you will see an image of a sad CR-48 and a warning about
image verification being turned off. Simply press <i>ctrl+D</i> to bypass this
warning and continue booting Chrome OS. The first time you boot in Developer Mode,
Chrome OS will give you a warning message and wipe the machine back to factory
defaults. As all of your apps and documents are stored on the Internet, all this
really means is that the machine will forget your Google account and will need to
be reconfigured against your WiFi AP.
