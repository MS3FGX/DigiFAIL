<h1>What is it?</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The AIRcable Host XR is an exceptionally powerful
USB Bluetooth adapter. It can be used with any and all Bluetooth software
because, as far as the software is concerned, it is no different from any other
adapter you would use. The difference is the insanely powerful transmitter,
outputting at 200 mW (double the power output of the highest conventional
Bluetooth device), coupled with a standard RP-SMA antenna connector which will
be immediately familiar to anyone who has worked with WiFi hardware. When
linked to a directional antenna, two Host XRs can communicate for up to 30 KM.
For more practical use, you can connect it to a 9 dBi omni-directional antenna,
which will give you a range of hundreds of meters when working with standard
Bluetooth devices like phones and headsets.
<p>
This device is based on the extremely well supported Cambridge Silicon Radio
chipset, which has a number of tools specifically geared for it. This enables
advanced functions not possible on other Bluetooth devices, like MAC spoofing
and direct low-level access to the baseband radio.

<h1>XR2: Electric Boogaloo</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, AIRcable has introduced the Host XR2 and
discontinued the Host XR in the process. For awhile you could buy the Host XR
at a steep discount from the AIRcable online store (50% off), but as of this
writing they have now sold out the rest of their old stock. You can still get
the older Host XR on eBay for pretty cheap though.
<p>
The XR and XR2 are <i>exactly</i> the same in terms of capability, and anything
you can do with one you can do with the other. The XR2 represents an aesthetic
design change, with a much more modern external casing than the original XR. It
also features retail-friendly blister packaging, rather than the ZipLock
Freezer bag that my XR was sent to me in. Both of these changes are an
attempted capitalization on the fact that the Host XR series is essentially the
only mass-marketable product AIRcable has in their line; it is conceivable that
the average person might even pick one of these things up in their local
electronics shop if it was marketed correctly. Coverage on a few technology
blogs about using the Host XR with Bluetooth headsets and headphones have
helped that along a bit.
<p>
If you can get a cheap XR, go ahead and do it. You won't lose any functionality
over the XR2, and personally, I find the design of the XR a little more
appealing; the XR2 looks more at home in an adult toy store than the desk of a
hacker, but to each his own.
<h1>Practical Range</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spec sheet from AIRcable lists the maximum range
of the Host XR at 30 KM, but of course that is only under laboratory conditions
and with two Host XRs connected to high-gain directional antennas. It doesn't
mean anything for it's real world performance, which is what most people are
interested in.
<p>
I set out to test the realistic range of the Host XR in the most simplistic
way possible. I had somebody hold a cellphone set to discoverable mode, put one
of the Host XRs on the roof of my car, and started driving. Once I lost signal
I would switch to the next higher gain antenna, until I got to the directional
parabolic. It should be said that maximum range with the directional parabolic
antenna is likely higher than what is reported here, but at these distances
keeping the target aligned becomes prohibitively difficult.
<p>
Distance was measured with the free Android application
<a href="http://eclipsim.com/gpsstatus/" target="_blank">GPS Status</a>. In my
mind this is easily the best GPS software available on the Android platform,
and is exceptionally useful for finding direction and range to an arbitrary
target. It is a great tool for wardriving, geocaching, or just exploring. Of
course, as range was found via GPS there is an estimated position error of
roughly 3 meters. As such, the ranges reported here have actually been rounded
down from the measurement reported by GPS Status.
<p>
As a control, I also tested the range of the cheapest Bluetooth adapter I could
find, SKU
<a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.16229~r.58964868" target="_blank">16229</a>, from DealExtreme. I was actually surprised at how well this
device performed, I expected considerably worse for a $4 item.
<p>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hardware/hostxr2.png" alt="Host XR Range" /></span>
<p>
As you can see, the range with even the stock 3 dBi antenna is more than twice
that of a Class 1 Bluetooth device. The biggest surprise of this test for me
was how little the range was increased using the 9 dBi over the stock antenna.
In fact, I also tested a 5 dBi antenna, but the difference in signal strength
was so small I didn't even bother to record it.
<p>
The biggest winner, of course, was the monster 19 dBi parabolic antenna. Even
with a very rough alignment to the target, this antenna achieved just shy of
400 meters, or 1/4 of a mile.
<p>
As I said, a number of things could have been done to push the range even
farther. Better alignment of the directional antenna would have been highly
beneficial, and an elevated position would have significantly increased the
range (and made alignment easier as well). You could also use an external 2.4
GHz amplifier to push more power through the dish, as truthfully, a 200 mW radio
doesn't really have the power to drive a 19 dBi dish. But again, this test was
not to push the hardware to the envelope (though it might be an interesting
project), but to give an idea as to what results you might expect in the field.
<h1>What can you do with it?</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, think of anything you can do with a normal
Bluetooth device...and just do it at a greater distance. This means everything
from simply scanning for discoverable devices to launching an active attack
with something like Bluetooth Stack Smasher. Imagine how much more effective
and dangerous Bluetooth vulnerabilities are when the range is extended 5 or 10
times what the average user is expecting. One of the things that has kept
Bluetooth security on the back burner in many people's minds is the fact that
Bluetooth is generally a very short range protocol. It is assumed that any
attacker would have to be so close to you that it would make any serious attack
impractical. But with hardware like this, you can enumerate and attack even a
moving target from a considerable distance. If you are fixed on one relatively
static target (say, the Bluetooth headset of a person sitting by their office
window) you can even employ a high-gain directional antenna to push your useful
range even farther. Such a setup was used by security researchers to
successfully attack a standard cell phone from over 1 mile away, and the only
hardware they had was a regular USB Bluetooth adapter modified with an external
antenna lead.
<p>
You could also use the Host XR in your very own
<a href="/projects/bt_rng.shtml">bt_rng</a> cluster! Impress your friends as you
generate marginally good random data at ridiculously slow speeds with your
expensive piece of industrial hardware! In fact, the Host XR doesn't generate
random data any better or faster than the super cheap "Mini" Bluetooth adapters
sold online for $4, but it certainly looks cooler.
<h1>Firmware Modification</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As this device is based on the BlueCore4 with
external firmware EEPROM it <i>should</i> be possible to modify it with the
firmware from <a href="http://www.fte.com/" target="_blank">Frontline's</a>
Bluetooth sniffing hardware. This would give you RAW access to over-the-air
Bluetooth communication, allowing for all sorts of interesting things like
cracking PINs at 100 meters.
<p>
Unfortunately, as the process to put the newer firmware releases onto regular
hardware has changed, and due to the fact that doing it wrong will brick the
hardware, I have been unable to work on this yet. I have bought a second Host
XR specifically for this purpose, and will update this page if I find out
anything useful.
<h1>Bluetooth Marketing</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another interesting feature of these devices is that
they are the only devices which (officially) work with AIRcable's open source
Bluetooth marketing system, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/proximitymarketing/" target="_blank">OpenProximity</a>. While technically any Bluetooth device
would work, OpenProximity blocks anything but the Host XR line of devices as
they are the only Bluetooth devices powerful enough to be useful for proximity
marketing. Plus the hardware sales are what keep AIRcable and development of
OpenProximity going, so they aren't about to let you run it with the $4 adapter
you got off of DealExtreme.
<p>
I hope to document the setup and use of an experimental OpenProximity in the
near future. I am interested in how the system works, and what interesting
applications there are for being able to push data into unsuspecting user's
devices.
