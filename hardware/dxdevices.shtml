<h1>DealExtreme.com</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think most people browsing my site are probably
the sort of people who already know about
<a href="http://dx.com/?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">DealExtreme.com</a>;
but if not, DealExtreme is a site that sells all manners of strange gadgets and
devices direct from Chinese manufacturers, with <i>free</i> worldwide shipping.
Well, the shipping cost is tacked onto the item price, naturally, but the
prices for some of these items are simply beyond belief.
<p>
Of course, there is always a downside. From the time you place your order to
the time it actually arrives on your doorstep can take anywhere from 3 weeks to
3 months (and yes, I personally have waited up to 3 months on a DX order).
Customer support is also notoriously troublesome, with responses occasionally
taking weeks. Though the one nice thing I can say about DX customer service is
that if they send you the wrong item, in many cases they will send out a
replacement and not ask for the other one back. I have gotten a few extra items
this way in the past. Finally, one of the biggest problems with DX (at least in
my mind) is the unacceptable delays in posting user reviews, or the reviews
never getting posted in the first place. There are some absolutely
<i>terrible</i> items sold on DX, and if they won't put up my reviews about
them there, I will just have to post them on my own site.
<p>
On this page I will be covering a small fraction of the devices and items I
have ordered from DX over the years. I'll only put up the ones I think there
will be some interest in, as many of the things I order are simply novelties
that have no practical purpose. I will be putting items and devices up here in
no particular order, and expect to regularly add to this page as I order new
things and get a chance to play with them.
<h1>Mini Bluetooth (16229)</h1>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hardware/dxdevices2.jpg" alt="16229" /></span>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For $2.17 (in bulk orders),
<a href="http://dx.com/p/16229?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 16229</a>
is the cheapest USB Bluetooth adapter I am personally aware of (that actually
works). I have ordered somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 of these devices for
my various projects and machines here, and they have been of
consistently...usable quality. These are by no means high-quality devices, but
they serve their purpose and rarely give me issues.
<p>
These are the adapters which most of the nodes ran during the creation and
testing of <a href="/projects/bt_rng.shtml">bt_rng</a>. I was also able to
confirm the functional range of this adapter to be 30 meters during the
<a href="/hardware/hostxr.shtml">Host XR range test</a>. They are based on a
low-end version of the Cambridge Silicon Radio chipset:
<pre><code>bash:~# hciconfig hci0 version revision
hci0:	Type: USB
	BD Address: 00:11:67:6A:XX:XX ACL MTU: 310:10 SCO MTU: 64:8
	HCI Ver: 2.0 (0x3) HCI Rev: 0xc5c LMP Ver: 2.0 (0x3) LMP Subver: 0xc5c
	Manufacturer: Cambridge Silicon Radio (10)
	Unified 21e
	Chip version: BlueCore4-ROM
	Max key size: 128 bit
	SCO mapping:  HCI
</code></pre>
Note that this device (and all of the DealExtreme Bluetooth adapters, for that
matter) uses the BlueCore4-ROM version of the CSR chipset, which means they
lack the external flash storage that is required for making permanent changes
like replacing the firmware or writing a new MAC address to the device. This
does limit your capability a bit, but these adapters are just fine for
scanning. If you want to do more advanced work, like sniffing PINs, you need an
adapter with BlueCore4-External, like the
<a href="/hardware/hostxr.shtml">AIRcable Host XR</a>.
<p>
As a side note,
<a href="http://dx.com/p/12696?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 12696</a>
appears to be an identical clone to SKU 16229, just at a higher price point. As
the capabilities of these two adapters are identical, they are both good choices
for basic Bluetooth research...but since one costs more than double the other,
the choice between them is pretty obvious.
<h1>Mini Bluetooth (11866)</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, above I mentioned SKU 16229 was the cheapest
<i>working</i> Bluetooth adapter I am aware of. That is because DX also sells
another adapter with the same name under
<a href="http://dx.com/p/11866?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 11866</a>
for $1.80 ($1.13 in bulk); this adapter is <i>not</i> the same as SKU 16229 and
is in fact complete garbage. I ordered 10 of SKU 11866 once I saw how cheap
they were, and not only did they all come with the same default MAC address
(making them useless for many tasks), but one of them actually got so hot when
plugged in that I could smell plastic melting. These two devices are identical
externally, but when you check the device information you can see it isn't the
same:
<pre><code>bash:~# hciconfig hci0 version revision
hci0:	Type: USB
	BD Address: 00:15:83:15:A1:DA ACL MTU: 672:4 SCO MTU: 48:1
	HCI Ver: 2.0 (0x3) HCI Rev: 0xc5c LMP Ver: 2.0 (0x3) LMP Subver: 0xc5c
	Manufacturer: Cambridge Silicon Radio (10)
	Build 0
	Chip version: BlueCore01a
	Max key size: 0 bit
	SCO mapping:  PCM
</pre></code>
BlueCore01a is an ancient version of the CSR chipset, and is worthless for
almost anything you could possibly want to do with it. I have also heard some
reports that recent batches of this SKU are using the Broadcom BCM2210 chipset,
which is marginally less terrible, but doesn't have the software support that
CSR enjoys. Unless you just want to scan for remote devices, please don't buy
SKU 11866.
<h1>Class 1 BT Dongle (14484)</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://dx.com/p/14484?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 14484</a> is a cheap knock-off of the
Linksys BT100, and even for a knock-off, it is absolute garbage. It's nothing
more than a standard Bluetooth adapter with a thin piece of wire soldered
(poorly) to the internal antenna. It is certainly not Class 1, and if anything,
it seems like the "antenna" they added hinders performance. Take note of the
expert LED mod they did here as well:
<p>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hardware/dxdevices3.jpg" alt="Garbage" /></span>
<p>
This is one of the first items that DX refused the images and review I
submitted for it, so I wanted to make sure I got this one on the site. At $8 it
is one of the worst Bluetooth adapters you can buy on DX. Please never buy this
item for any reason.
<h1>Mag Stripe Reader (17726)</h1>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hardware/dxdevices4.jpg" alt="17726" /></span>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of this writing,
<a href="http://dx.com/p/17726?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 17726</a> is unfortunately no longer available on DX. For $20 it is a
decent quality USB magnetic stripe reader that appears as a USB HID to the host
OS. Well, that is the idea anyway. I found that this doesn't always work as
expected under Linux, and the reader only seems to work randomly. This is an
exceptionally annoying problem, but I have never found any workable solution
and the kernel's error messages are not terribly helpful. I suspect the
internal firmware on this device doesn't comply 100% with the USB HID
specifications, and that a kernel driver would need to be made/modified to
accept this device as HID based on it's USB VID/PID, regardless of what it
appears to be. But I have yet to dive into kernel hacking so I haven't been
able to implement anything. The only output from the kernel when this device is
connected (and not working) is:
<pre><code>usb 6-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
usb 6-2: config 1 interface 0 altsetting 0 has 2 endpoint descriptors,
different from the interface descriptor's value: 1
usb 6-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
input: HID f725:f834 as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:10.1/usb6/6-2/6-2:1.0/input/input21
input: USB HID v1.10 Keyboard [HID f725:f834] on usb-0000:00:10.1-2
drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c: ctrl urb status -75 received
</code></pre>
This device has a small DIP switch on the bottom which is used to toggle
optional post-processing of the ASCII card data. DIP 1 toggles LF after
outputting the string, and DIP 2 toggles pre/postfix control characters (; and
?, respectively). The third DIP is supposed to switch the reader between tracks
1/2 and 2/3, but apparently doesn't actually do anything.
<p>
All in all, this is a decent buy for an easy to interface mag reader, but the
fact it only works reliably under Windows is a pretty big drawback. It is also
rather large for such a relatively simple device, but that is not nearly as big
a problem.
<h1>USB to RS232 Dongle (5859)</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/hardware/dxdevices5.jpg" alt="5859" /></span>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not a whole lot to say about this one, other than
that it is a very handy tool to have around. For under $4,
<a href="http://dx.com/p/5859?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 5859</a> it's worth keeping in your parts box just in case you need to
quickly interface a serial device with one of your machines. This device is
obviously designed for machines that lack serial ports, but even on machines
that do have serial ports, I find it is more convenient to simply use this
device in the front USB ports than reach around the back to the serial.
<p>
I have also had situations where some serial devices wouldn't work on my
<i>actual</i> serial port, but worked through this. For example, I have had
problems getting the <a href="/hardware/mini.shtml">AIRcable Mini</a> to talk
over an actual serial port, but it has no problem through this adapter.
<p>
This device is a particularly good buy as it uses the very well supported
Prolific PL2303 chipset, which will work in basically any modern OS right out
of the box. It also supports <i>all</i> RS-232 signals, such as RTS/CTS and
DTR/DSR. A lot of cheap adapters leave these out to cut costs, so it is pretty
impressive that it has them in. I know some people have also modified this
device to work with TTL-level signals by disabling the MAX232 chip inside.
<p>
<i><b>Update:</b></i> I have read some reports that new versions of this device
are shipping with the CH341 chipset rather than the more common PL2303. I
have not been able to personally verify the new adapters have switched
chips, but at least CH341 chipset is fairly well supported if it has. So if
your only concern is getting an adapter that works on all of your computers,
you will still be fine, the only problem you might have is if you need a
PL2303 device specifically.
<h1>Dummy SIM Cards (16159)</h1>
<span class="center"><img src="/images/hardware/dxdevices6.jpg" alt="16159" /></span>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://dx.com/p/16159?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 16159</a> is a 10 pack of dummy SIM cards,
which are invaluable when working with cell phones, as many brands of GSM phone
won't start without a valid SIM inserted. During my Bluetooth research I picked
up dozens of cheap phones off of eBay to test with, so luckily they are a
pretty good value at just under $4 a pack.
<p>
Keep in mind though that not all phones require a SIM to operate. For example,
in my experience most Nokia phones don't require them, while Motorola phones
usually do. Also, if the phone you are working with is locked to a particular
carrier, then these alone won't get the phone working. The phone will
<i>start</i> with the dummy SIM, but when it tries to connect to the cell
network it will fail (unless, perhaps, you live in China where these SIMs were
pulled from). To get past the carrier lock, you will need...
<h1>i-SmartSim Unlocker (12167)</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/hardware/dxdevices7.jpg" alt="12167" /></span>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://dx.com/p/12167?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 12167</a> is a very small device that
piggy-backs onto a SIM card and fools the phone into thinking it is for the
carrier the phone is locked to. You can use this device to perform a physical
unlock on your phone (say for example, if you wanted to use the iPhone on
T-Mobile), or you can combine this with SKU 16159 to get even carrier locked
phones to boot up without the original SIM. The DealExtreme page says this
device is designed primarily for Nokia phones, but personally I have been able
to use it on phones from a number of different manufacturers without any
issues.
<p>
To install this device you need to cut out a little notch on the top part of
the SIM, as shown in the picture above. This area of the SIM is simply plastic,
and doesn't contain the actual SIM chip, which is located on the opposite side
of the gold contacts. There is no danger of cutting too far into the SIM and
destroying it, so don't be afraid to cut out a little more than I did. I used a
Dremel to cut out the square, but if you have snips small enough you should be
able to get in there, or maybe use a small hobby razor knife. I would suggest
tacking the unlocker and the SIM together with some <i>very</i> small drops of
cyanoacrylate adhesive (AKA, Super Glue or Krazy Glue) around the extreme edges
of the SIM. You need to be very careful not to put too much on, or else it may
overflow onto the actual SIM contacts under the unlocker, in which case you are
in some real trouble. If you don't glue them together, it makes it much more
difficult to insert and remove the SIM/unlocker, though not impossible.
<p>
I have never personally found a phone this didn't work on, though I am told
newer handsets might have issues (for which DX sells an updated version of this
product). While this should certainly not be taken as a compatibility list in
any shape or form, I can at least confirm the i-SmartSim works perfectly on the
following phones:
<p>
<b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ericsson T39m
<br>	
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LG CU575
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Motorola Razr V3
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nokia 2600
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nokia 6555b
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Samsung A737</b>
<h1>100g Digital Scale (15002)</h1>
<span class="right"><img src="/images/hardware/dxdevices8.jpg" alt="15002" /></span>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://dx.com/p/15002?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 15002</a>
is an extremely accurate digital scale at an incredible price ($10.87 as of
this writing), perfect for weighing small objects and chemistry work. This
scale features a maximum capacity of 100g, with a precision of 0.01g. The scale
comes with a fake-leather carrying case that protects it pretty well, and there
is a plastic snap-on protector for the actual weighing platform.
<p>
If you are going to get this scale and want to make sure it is as accurate as
possible, you should also order the 100g calibration weight
(<a href="http://dx.com/p/15761?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 15761</a>).
Even if the scale is perfectly accurate when you receive it (which is already
unlikely as movement tends to knock it out of precision), with time and temperature
changes the accuracy of the scale will begin to drift. To calibrate the scale,
hold the "On" button until "0" flashes and place the calibration weight on the
scale; after a few seconds the weight should peg at "100.00" and stop flashing.
Once calibrated, you should verify the calibration of the scale every so often
by simply placing the calibration weight on scale and verifying it still reads
"100.00".
<p>
If you need higher capacity, this same scale is available in models all the way
up to 300g. After that, there is a trade off between accuracy and capacity.
Scales above 500g usually only offer 0.1g resolution. If you are looking for
very high resolution, you may want to check out
<a href="http://dx.com/p/10515?Utm_rid=58964868&Utm_source=affiliate" target="_blank">SKU 10515</a>,
which appears to be the highest resolution scale currently offered on DealExtreme.
