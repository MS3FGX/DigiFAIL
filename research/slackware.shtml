<h1>Slackware Linux</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An ISO for Slackware Linux was the first thing I
downloaded when I <i>finally</i> got broadband at my house. For a year or so
prior to that, I had wanted desperately to try out Linux and had been reading
about every distribution I could, preparing myself for the day I would finally
have the bandwidth to make my dream a reality. At the time I was considering
what I believe to be the "Big Three": Slackware, Debian, Gentoo. I consider
these the core distributions because so many other distributions are based on
them or borrow concepts from them. Which of course is not surprising, as these
are 3 of the very first successful GNU/Linux distributions; naturally upstarts
would try and mimic them as closely as possible in their perceived strengths.
<p>
I finally decided on Slackware Linux because it seemed to be the closest to
what my idea of an operating system should be. After downloading that very
first ISO, I can honestly say that the course of my entire life changed. Linux
became not only one of my biggest hobbies, but indeed an increasingly large
part of my professional life. I have no doubt in my mind that, had I chosen a
different distribution to download, I would not have the same level of
knowledge about the Linux kernel or the GNU system that I do today. While I
acknowledge that not everyone wants (or even needs) to understand the
low-level workings of their operating system, I strongly suggest that
anyone who <i>does</i> take a look at starting their journey with
Slackware. While distributions like Ubuntu certainly have the limelight
today (and not without good reason), Slackware will always have its
place, and its fans, in the Linux world.
<p>
<h1>Involvement with Slackware</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I am not officially involved with the
Slackware Linux project, I have from time to time submitted suggestions and
fixes upstream which have been implemented in the stable releases; such as the
Bluetooth implementation used in Slackware 12.2 - 13.0.
